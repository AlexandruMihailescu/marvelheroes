Test Center 11.12.2015:
Ok, so I've tried Danny around for some time, and while there's a lot of awesome things about him (those animations are sweet, from Chi Blast and the Ultimate, to all of Fury of Five Forces), here's what I suggest to improve him:

1.Add sprint Movement power


2.Make Fury of Five Forces unusable when no stance is active or add an animation for this situation (even though it wouldn't make sense). I don't enjoy the T-pose (easily reproduced if you use a Chi-regeneration affix and try to use it after you've gained enough - which brings me to my 3rd suggestion; fun-fact: for some reason you are using the Snake Stance visual for default Spirit - I would've gone with the Dragon Stance, Shou-Lao being a dragon, but considering I shouldn't have seen that, I'm going to end my rambling here).


3.Chi: no restore, no reduction, outside of special Iron Fist mechanics. Do not allow it to recharge (currently able to do it) or any affix to affect Chi cost of powers (already happening). If you do not wish to have this happen, please ignore the Passive effect of the power introduced as my 7th suggestion.


4.Modify Like Unto Iron to add:
 "Dash to your enemy and [use the power of .... - the rest of the tooltip]
 Execute: +1% damage per 1% of target's missing Health"


5.Add some form of damage negation while channeling Immortal Weapon or make it heal more as an initial burst with a 4s cooldown


6.Add specialisation to Immortal Weapon:
"Healing Chi - Can target allies" - it seems unreasonable to have the initial in-game healer (Avengers Tower and Luke Cage summon) not healing, especially since he does it in the comics


7.Add a 1-point lvl 1 power, like Magik's, to Fighting Focus or Chi Control trees reading something along the lines of:
 "Sustained Combat
 This Power does not gain in benefits with additional power points and has a Maximum Rank of 1.
 Passive:
 Your spiritual energy resource, Chi, is only restorable as described below. 
 Your powers are unaffected by Cost Reduction affixes.
 While Toggled Off:
 Stance Openers restore 100% of your Maximum Chi and have a 16s duration.
 While Toggled On:
 Stance Openers last until you enter another stance.
 Restore 6.25% of your Maximum Chi twice per second. (or 12.5% per second, it's just the total divided by the 8s a full recharge would take in a 2-stance rotation)"


8.Increase damage (slightly) of Chi Blast or decrease animation time (would prefer increased damage, to enjoy the full animation)


9.Stance Openers: Love the idea of having some attacks also start a stance, however, in the current situation, they're 1-pointers. They need slightly increased damage, or they won't be viable. If you're implementing my 7th suggestion, I would further introduce a 50 Chi spirit cost to them when Sustained Combat is turned on.


Possible bug that gave me an idea: currently, for me chi-cost reduction works only to reduce the cooldown on the signature move. I don't know if this is intended or not, but I found it fitting, it doesn't bug me, but I would change the cooldown reduction to originate from not using chi, though; I'd just have it: use any Chi above 50% of your Maximum Chi to reduce this power's cooldown by that percentage. Look at how mentally draining his Iron Fist power is in the comics - if he's rested, he could use some of his spiritual energy to be able to use it again sooner.

Doesn't make sense: The power "Fury of Five Forces": as Chi depletes to 0 automatically after your stance exits cooldown, what's the point of having a Chi-spending power state that it deals 20% less damage when you're not using any Stance. It would make sense, however, if you implement my 7th suggestion (then, you could be in a stance, have some chi available, but you not gain the 25% bonus, after 16s have passed since the stance change).

Tooltip bugs:
 - Fury of Five Hundred Fists - missing a comma after "If in Tiger Stance"
 - Crane Kick - the second statement should read "While in Crane Stance, your attacks"
EDIT:
 - Black Black Poison Touch - it should be named "Black-Black Poison Touch" and there's also a comma missing after "If in Serpent Stance"

Synergy: Either Iron Fist should have 3% Mental Damage, or She-Hulk 2%, like others have said - no double standards please
